## Competition Experience

### The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM)
- **Time:** 2025.02
- **Prize:** Meritorious Winner (<b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">First Prize, the top 6 %</i></b>)
- **Description:** As the team lead, I spearheaded the development of an Olympic Games medal prediction and coaching effect analysis system. I proposed an innovative BPNN-RF hybrid model (backpropagation neural network-random forest fusion model), which enhanced prediction robustness and accuracy through ensemble learning and nonlinear mapping. Utilizing Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, I completed over 100 iterations, with the final model achieving highly consistent predictions compared to actual data on the test set (2024 Olympics), validating its effectiveness. Additionally, I designed a quantitative evaluation framework for the "Great Coach Effect," defining the "Great Coach Coefficient" and combining it with MAE metrics to quantify the significant contribution of top coaches to medal counts.

### Mathematics Competition of Chinese College Students
- **Time:** 2025.09
- **Prize:** <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">First Prize, the top 5 %</i></b>
